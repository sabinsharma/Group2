# Group2 v1
Group2 Presentation

# Introduction

Good afternoon everyone, thank you for taking your time to see us. We are Group 2 and we would like to talk to you about what could be an exciting collaboration to help you make the most of your website platform to help patients and staff get the most out of your services and more time to do the things they love.

Whenever I visit Muskoka I am reminded of 2 main things:

The beauty of the Canadian countryside

And

A community spirit and a welcoming attitude that is unique to Muskoka in the region.

On your website you describe yourselves as a proud community hospital, echoing values associated with a strong community spirit, values of respect, compassion and high standards of service to the community

We believe these values are important and what makes a hospital such as yours a shining example of patient and community focussed care.

Through our proposal you will see that these values are important to us too and we want to work with you to make the hospital a beacon to this community spirit that is so important and unique to Muskoka.  

#Problem Statement
Some points to talk mention at presentation:
	1. Current website represents an inclusive and patient-focused approach. But we want to expand on this.
	2. Expand on an existing website, to make most out of it. More user-centered, more user-focused.
	3. User Experience is of the essence (make the user interaction with website even more convenient).
	4. Combination of ‘design thinking’ and ‘user-centered design’ approaches.

# Objection proposed

Objection: Budget is too high
Response:
1.	 We can negotiate the amount of work on the hospital. We may reduce some functions client deem unnecessary.
2.	Ask whether the problem is on the amount paid on certain milestones.

Objection budget too low

Objection: We don’t have the manpower for the technical skill managing the website  
Response:
1.	Our CMS will be user friendly so anyone could use it with ease.
2.	There will be training included so everyone in the hospital will know how to use the CMS

Objection: We don’t like how the design look
Response:
1.	The design is not finalized and there is 3 chance of design review with the Client’s input.
	
Objection: We are comfortable with our current website
Response:
1.	Having an updated, easy to use, and responsive website will impact on the prospect donation, new nurses or doctors looking to work or doing an internship in your hospital.

Objection:  Timeline too long
Response:
1.	Try to explain that taking a proper development time will benefit in having a long running stable system.
2.	We can have some of the function simplified to shorten the timeline from what we have proposed.






#Conclusion
