# Group2 v1
Group2 Presentation

# Introduction

Good afternoon everyone, thank you for taking your time to see us. We are Group 2 and we would like to talk to you about what could be an exciting collaboration to help you make the most of your website platform to help patients and staff get the most out of your services and more time to do the things they love.

Whenever I visit Muskoka I am reminded of 2 main things:

The beauty of the Canadian countryside

And

A community spirit and a welcoming attitude that is unique to Muskoka in the region.

On your website you describe yourselves as a proud community hospital, echoing values associated with a strong community spirit, values of respect, compassion and high standards of service to the community

We believe these values are important and what makes a hospital such as yours a shining example of patient and community focussed care.

Through our proposal you will see that these values are important to us too and we want to work with you to make the hospital a beacon to this community spirit that is so important and unique to Muskoka.  

# Problem Statement
Some points to talk mention at presentation:
	1. Current website represents an inclusive and patient-focused approach. But we want to expand on this.
	2. Expand on an existing website, to make most out of it. More user-centered, more user-focused.
	3. User Experience is of the essence (make the user interaction with website even more convenient).
	4. Combination of ‘design thinking’ and ‘user-centered design’ approaches.

# CMS Description
Starting Statement
Using a content management system(CMS) to power your site could be one of the best investments you make in your website. your website is one of your main tools for communicating with your donor, staff, patient and visitor and you want to make sure they love it. But that doesn’t mean you want to get bogged down in technical details. A CMS marries “power with simplicity” so you still have time to concentrate on improving your services. 

“Makes Life Easy”. I guess everyone has Facebook account here, Would it not be interesting if you could publish website like you update your pictures and status in Facebook?

•	It's easy for the non-technically minded. 
o	Not all user has the same comfort level with technologies
o	If you can use word you can use CMS for the basic functions
o	Don’t have to spent much time in training.
 
•	It allows multiple users. 
o	Users posting blog and user posting contents for the blog
o	A CMS makes it easy to manage roles and publishing permissions for all these users so that only those you allow can publish content and content only goes live when you’re ready.
Doing things once and let it do the rest?
•	It improves site maintenance.
o	100 of pages and making changes to each page is not a good idea
o	With the CMS, underlying architecture is the same and it makes the changes of digital content easy and effortless. 
o	 change in your administrative dashboard and have it automatically propagate to the entire site
o	consistent appearance and is great for branding
•	It helps you manage content.
o	Its not just about publishing content but also removing old contents
o	Events held in Christmas will have to be probably remove during new year and add new banner for a new year events.
o	all menus and links update automatically, so that your targeted users continue to have a good experience of the site
•	You're in control.
o	 with a CMS you are in control, with the ability to assign tasks and roles and to check progress at any time. That puts you in the driving seat when it comes to this important business tool.

# Timeline

We have outlined a proposed timeline of 21 weeks until deployment based on what we’ve discussed.

The first three weeks will be used to produce a Feasibility Study which will help to develop and cement the specific tasks required to complete your website. 

We will then work on the graphic design and interface design for your website, and develop the fundemental functionality required.

Backend development and coding of the content and the content management system will follow in the 7th week and is the longest part of the process. 

It  is always important to give this a significant amount of time since we operate with an “Agile” work methodology which allows to us to focus on developing, testing and delivering each part of your project as we proceed.

3 weeks training at the end on CMS + work together to organise a convenient schedule for us to work with your staff for this. 

For added convenience this training can be run remotely and we will also produce a document to help with this process.

During the 14 days – 3 additional sessions after project delivery and during the website’s “deployment” phase, 
-	address any technical issues and/or changes. We recommend that you compile any changes you need, any further changes will be billable.

#Conclusion


Having shown our proposal ,we believe that you understand the benefits of a redesigned solution for your website. 
Group 2  is highly enthusiastic about the opportunity to work with Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare to redesign its website. We believe in providing hospital with high quality solution that will be effective and easy to manage. Our new design will satisfy the needs of  hospital staff and the end users as well.
We look forward to be working with Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare on this exciting redesign and welcome any questions in regard to this proposal.
					Thank You!
